        <h2>Know More!</h2>

        <p>In a bold move to understand the remote workforce dynamics and to reverse talent migration to major cities,
            Mahendra NextWealth is launching a comprehensive survey targeting workforce that is either working from
            work-from-home or hybrid model. This initiative aims to shed light on the key demographics and domain
            expertise within the remote talent pool, while also solidifying its commitment to decentralizing
            opportunities and empowering individuals to work from their native towns and villages.</p>

        <p>However, the initiative goes beyond mere data collection. Mahendra NextWealth is motivated by a larger
            vision: countering the migration trend towards major cities. By understanding the demographics and expertise
            of the remote employees, the company aims to identify training programs and communication strategies to
            better support them. Ultimately, this fosters a more inclusive and adaptable work environment, encouraging
            individuals to contribute their talents remotely from their hometownÂ communities.</p>
